# Nicaragua_dengue

In a project of modeling dengue transmission in a prospective pediatric cohort in Nicaragua, we developed a software program in R coupled with C++ for simulating dengue epidemics and for making Bayesian inference on serotype-specific infection risks and associated effects of historical infections as well as other risk factors, while accounting for incompletely observed infection history and disease outcomes. To reduce the computational burden of sampling unobserved infection history, the program offers the option of sampling either two serotypes or all four serotypes simultaneously. This program can be generalized to cohort data of other infectious pathogens for which reliable surveillance data exist.

1/2/4serotype.zip is the code for estimation using 1/2/4 serotype sampling when updating infection histroy.
